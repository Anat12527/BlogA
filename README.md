### Motivation :muscle:
  
I am a big lover of books, and I love to share my thoughts and opinions on what I read, so I thought it was about time that I created a book blog.
Also and most important the purpose of this blog is to make people be aware of reading importance and the benefits of it.:star:
In my mind the importance of a book to help us learn and understand things cannot be underestimated.
Happy reading! :relaxed: :orange_book:
